# Bellabeat
Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

1.1 Statement of task
This analysis seeks to reveal the trend in smart device used by consumers in their daily activities such as walk, sleeping monitoring, heart-beat rate, calories and weight loss. This seeks to reveal the most common features in the smart device used by consumers and how this trend can inform bellabeat marketing strategy.

1.2 Key stakeholder(s)
Bellabeat
Founders: Urška Sršen and Sando Mur

2.0 Introduction into the dataset¶
We will dive into the dataset by keeping the original dataset and making a copy for our analysis in order to maintain the originallity of the data.

2.1 About the dataset
This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors /preferences.

2.2 Source
The dataset was put together by FitBit Fitness. Please [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)] for more information to ready more about the dataset.

2.3 Data Intergrity, Privacy and Credibility
We verified the authenticity of the data and also privacy, security, and accessibility. This data seeks to be used for it intense purpose, only for business analysis for Bellabeat.

We have seen that only sleep_day file contains three duplicated values. And there is no NA value in our selected dataset. Let's remove the duplicate and test to confirm.

Now, we can see that our four files are fully cleaned and merged as daily_merged with all the neccessary data in columns needed for our analysis to aid Bellabeat in the business strategy. In our next session, we shall proceed with the analysis to find statistical descriptive analysis, trends, correlations.

3.5 Data classification
Before we continue to the analysis part, let's look at how we can classify our data to have a specific cluster of groups. We can add the weekdays to our data using the date. And also, base on the classification made by Australia’s Physical Activity & Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Adults (18-64 Years) [click here for more ](https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/physical-activity-guidelines/australias-physical-activity-sedentary-behaviour-guidelines-adults-18-64-years/)] an individual's daily minutes for active walk can be classified as:

Accumulate 150 to 300 minutes (2 ½ to 5 hours) of moderate intensity physical activity
75 to 150 minutes (1 ¼ to 2 ½ hours) of vigorous intensity physical activity
Above 300 minutes (above 2 ½ hoiurs) Active intensity
Also a goal of 1000 steps target is recommended for every healthy adult. And according to their classification: [link here](https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/healthy-lifestyles/counting-steps/)]

Sedentary is less than 5,000 steps per day
Low active is 5,000 - 7,499 steps per day
Somewhat active is 7,500 - 9,999 steps per day
Active is more than 10,000 steps per day
Highly active is more than 12,500
We shall classify our data base on the total steps.

From figure 1, it's clearly shown confirms the descriptive analysis of the summary() function above. Figure 2 also indicates that on Saturdays, participants take a lot of walk, being high active and active usergroup. However, this does not confirm that many participants walk on Saturday. We shall establish this in our further analysis.

Now that we have established that participants take a lot of walk on Saturday, we shall further find out the day many participants go for walk.

From the graph above, we see that there is no correlation between participants daily steps taken and their minutes of sleeping. Hence individuals amount of minutes to sleep does not depends on the daily walk activity.

Figure 6 clearly shows that there a positive correlation between daily steps and daily calories. This confirms that the more steps participants takes, the more calories they burn. We can view this from the point of Saturday, which gives almost a perfect linear regression reconfirming that indeed, many steps were taken on this day.

On figure 8, there is no relation between number of step taken and amount of time in bed.

On figure 9, it clearing shows that distance covered commensurate with the number of steps taking in the day.

Figure 10 above indicates that users use their smart device in their stationary position(sedentary) for 49.45% out of 24hrs in a day, follow by 15.04% being lightly active whiles 1.74% represent "very active" time of using the device in a day. This shows that most users use the smart device either for sleep monitoring or heartrate reading.
